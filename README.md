The patient interface is a mobile application that allows users to log in, register, or access as a guest. The home page prominently displays “SOS” and “Volunteer” buttons for quick access. Selecting SOS prompts the user to specify the type of crisis and whether it is for themselves or someone else. From there, an AI-powered chatbot, which users can either text or speak to, collects critical information. It tailors its questions based on stored health data for registered users, mimicking those that paramedics typically ask. The chatbot compiles this information into a patient profile and provides real-time first-aid guidance, such as analyzing breathing through audio or assessing injuries via the camera, while waiting for paramedics.
